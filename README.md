# 6t_SRAM-4x4_Array

This project is dedicated to the realization of a 4x4 Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) array, leveraging a 2-to-4 Decoder to process 2-bit inputs and generate a 4-bit address for the array. The design and simulations are conducted utilizing Cadence Virtuoso software, a robust platform known for its efficacy in electronic design automation. The implementation employs 90nm Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology, chosen for its optimal performance characteristics. Simulation and transient analysis are seamlessly executed using the Cadence Analog Design Environment (ADE), ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the SRAM array's functionality and performance attributes. This repository serves as a repository for the development, documentation, and collaborative efforts pertaining to the analog layout design of the aforementioned 4x4 SRAM array.
